<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>My mom made this spaghetti all the time while I was growing up, except she also added some chopped green pepper and a can of golden mushroom soup. It is delicious!

<p>This recipe is great for the simple man. My boyfriend doesn't like a lot of fancy spices so simple good flavor is less confusing for the picky eater. Plus, it's fast! Add a can of diced tomatoes to add some texture and depth for you.</p>

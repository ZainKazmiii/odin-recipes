<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>I received several small eggplants from my daughter's garden, but what to do with them? Allrecipes to the rescue! This sounded the easiest, so I made it! Absolutely a winner! I used whole grain pasta, added a half onion in the sauté of garlic. I could only find Hunts Italian diced tomatoes so I used that. Let me tell you, this was superb. Very light tasting! Not heavy like some pasta dishes can get. My father-in-law and husband had second and third helpings! I gave a container to my vegetarian granddaughter and she loved it too! I will definitely make this again.</p>

<p>I really liked this recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to use it as a “base” recipe. I added fresh basil and oregano from my garden, salt and pepper to the sauce, and used only one garlic clove. Next time, I will add onion with the garlic. Grated Parmesan was good over the top. This is a keeper!</p>


<h3>Ingredients:</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    
        <li>1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can plum tomatoes with juice, chopped
        </li>
    
    
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
        </li>
    </ul> 


<h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring constantly, until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice; cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.</li>
        

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.

        <li>Pour sauce over pasta.

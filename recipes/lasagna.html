<h3 class="desc unique">Description:</h3>

<p>My husband really loved this. There is a lot of liquid, and when I saw how much of the sauce there was I knew there was no way this was fitting in an 8 in. baking dish. I made it in a deep 9x13 pan and it barely fit. I did modify a bit: used ricotta cheese instead of cottage so it was less watery; added 1 chopped jalape√±o to the sauce for a little more flavor and a bit of spice; did not have tomatoes with cilantro and lime so juiced 1/2 lime and chopped some cilantro into the sauce; and definitely need more than 5 tortillas, especially since it needs to go into a bigger dish. It has very good flavor, but the tortillas actually kind of disintegrate so you don't really have layers at the end.</p>


<p>This was an inspiration for me to make a vegetarian version. I used chopped cauliflower instead of meat. I started with some enchilada sauce (I used a small can), then layered the tortillas, cauliflower, whole black beans, and finely grated mozzarella. There were 2 layers like that with the top layer tortillas, the rest of the sauce and cheese. All together 2 cups of cheese.</p>

<h3 class="steps unique">Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in ground turkey; cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>

        <li>Mix cottage cheese, egg, and cumin together in a small bowl.    </li>

        <li>Spread 1/3 of the turkey sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the corn tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese mixture on top. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Mexican cheese on top. Repeat layers once more, ending with remaining turkey sauce and Mexican cheese.  </li>
        
        <li>Spray a large piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
   
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until top is browned, about 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with green onion. </li>
